How is a SQL statement executed in the database?

Step 1 - A SQL statement is sent to the database via a transport layer protocol (e.g.TCP).
Step 2 - The SQL statement is sent to the command parser, where it goes through syntactic and semantic analysis, and a query tree is generated afterward.
Step 3 - The query tree is sent to the optimizer. The optimizer creates an execution plan. 
Step 4 - The execution plan is sent to the executor. The executor retrieves data from the execution.
Step 5 - Access methods provide the data fetching logic required for execution, retrieving data from the storage engine. 
Step 6 - Access methods decide whether the SQL statement is read-only. If the query is read-only (SELECT statement), it is passed to the buffer manager for further processing. The buffer manager looks for the data in the cache or data files.
Step 7 - If the statement is an UPDATE or INSERT, it is passed to the transaction manager for further processing.
Step 8 - During a transaction, the data is in lock mode. This is guaranteed by the lock manager. It also ensures the transaction’s ACID properties.

SQL operations like GROUP BY, COUNT(*), DISTINCT and ORDER BY are so simple - but also very useful when exploring a new dataset.

Want to quickly find the most frequent values for a column? Use a GROUP BY, COUNT(*) and ORDER BY DESC

Want to find out how many duplicates there are in a table? Compare COUNT(DISTINCT *) with COUNT(*)

Want to get a feel for how many null values there are? Compare COUNT(<column-name>) with a COUNT(*) or simply run a COUNT(*) with a WHERE filter to remove the null values

There are many ways to skin the proverbial SQL cat - but these simple fundamentals will take you a long way!

Hope this helps 🙂

wowwwww did you know that you can access the first ever Node.js version on GitHub and explore its timeline by just browsing the git history? 😬🔥

It was early 2009 when Node.js got its first commit from its maker, Ryan Dahl, and today it is one of the most impacting project for the Web worldwide.

It's funny to see the history and check some commit messages such as "intermediate commit. nothing works.", "first compile", "add some printfs..", "request.respond works" and many others 🤣

Looking back, it seems that this first version was like a Proof of Concept. I'll share now what are the thoughts I had when looking at the source code.

The whole idea was to use Chrome's V8 API which was an engine made to interpret and execute JavaScript code in the browser.

In the first commit, he started creating HTTP Servers using the libebb, a lightweight high-performance HTTP server library for C, making interoperation with JavaScript where the JS Code would receive messages from the C++ and back and forth.

As far as I read the code, the first commits didn't the libev or libuv to manage async I/O operations as it's popular nowadays.

Instead, he used the liboi, an OpenCL Interferometry Library for C (which I have no idea what means 😂) to manage the event loop and changed it to a most performative event loop library then, the libev, right on the v.1.0.1

Back then, Node.js was 99% C/C++ code and he actually built a JavaScript-to-C script in Python to overcome some limitations he might have found when executing JS Scripts on the V8 Engine.

I love going back to feel how some tools became so popular, how a simple Proof Of Concept would change the Wide Web for good!

If you ask me now, I'd say C++ was/is the most powerful language ever. It's crazy to see how many great tools were built on top of it (and still it has been)

When a company decides to implement a new ERP or CRM solution, it usually recognises that there is going to be considerable change and impact on the organisation.
 
There will be changes in underlying software and technology, changes in job roles and responsibilities and changes in business processes.
 
Implementing a new ERP or CRM solution across a business can sometimes feel like a marathon and there is often a tendency for
business users to want to sprint straight to the end of the race.
 
Successful ERP and CRM implementation projects have common themes.
 
✅ They recognise the maturity of processes currently used in the business.
 
✅ They acknowledge there will be a gap between the ultimate process and the current process that determines what should be in the first release of the ERP or CRM at "go-live".
 
✅ They know that taking manageable and measurable steps in business process improvement is the best foundation for continuous improvement.
 
Combined Management Consultants uses the concept of "𝗖𝗿𝗮𝘄𝗹 𝗪𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗥𝘂𝗻" when implementing new technology and business processes across a complex enterprise wide project that may extend over multiple years. 
 
The concept of "𝗖𝗿𝗮𝘄𝗹 𝗪𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗥𝘂𝗻" recognises that there are certain steps that need to be completed before the organisation moves onto other stages of the implementation.
 
This is about continuous improvement. First mastering the basics of the new ERP or CRM solution, then extending the capabilities
before maximizing the outcomes.
 
I will share an infographic in the feed below that explains the alignment of capabilities supported by a well documented technology strategy.

Keen for your thoughts and/or feedback.

Yth. rekan-rekan fresh graduate, calon pekerja,

Dalam aturan ketenagakerjaan kita, pekerja dengan kontrak PKWT atau PKWTT juga memiliki hak cuti keperluan khusus/alasan tertentu dan tetap dibayarkan upahnya:

1. Pekerja menikah: 3 hari
2. Menikahkan anaknya: 2 hari
3. Mengkhitankan anaknya: 2 hari
4. Membaptiskan anaknya: 2 hari
5. Istri melahirkan/keguguran: 2 hari
6. Suami/istri, orang tua, mertua, anak dan/atau menantu meninggal dunia: 2 hari
7. Anggota keluarga selain yang disebutkan di atas yang tinggal dalam 1 rumah meninggal dunia: 1 hari

Jadi, kalau nanti bekerja dan terjadi hal-hal di atas tidak memotong hak cuti tahunannya ya.

Sehat selalu.
