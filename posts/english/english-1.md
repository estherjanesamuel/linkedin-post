No opportunity to practice your spoken English?
 
Not living in an English-speaking environment means less opportunity to practice your speaking.
 
I understand.
 
But this doesnâ€™t mean you canâ€™t achieve spoken fluency in English.
 
(Many of my Chinese colleagues and friends are fluent English speakers and they have never left China).
 
So, how can you practice your English speaking WITHOUT leaving China?
 
Here are 5 effective ways:
 
- Online Lessons
 
Perhaps the most obvious way â€“ speaking regularly with a professional English teacher and receiving guidance on how to improve your spoken English is very effective.
 
- Language Partners
 
Find an online language partner and practice your conversational English in exchange for conversational Chinese. Itâ€™s a great opportunity to practice for free and make friends.
 
- Expat communities
 
Living in a larger city? A lot of cafes and bars in expat areas host quizzes, stand-up comedy nights and other social events. Visit these events and start conversations.
 
- Record yourself
 
Make a daily audio or video diary by recording yourself on your phone talking about your work tasks. Practice using common words and phrases related to your work and make full sentences. Ask your language partner/English teacher for their feedback.
 
- Listen and repeat
 
Find an online video or audio clip in English relevant to your work (around 30-60 seconds long), listen to it several times and repeat it in the same way and pronunciation. Record yourself, listen back and correct any differences you hear. 
 
ðŸ‘‰ Making your speaking a priority and setting aside time to practice each day is the key to becoming fluent in English.
 
What do you think about these methods?
