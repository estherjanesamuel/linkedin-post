What would I do if I would have to start learning programming from absolute zero ðŸ”¥

This week a friend came out with a question about what steps should he do to start learning programming from scratch

He said many other people recommended a bunch of courses both Youtube videos and Udemy courses but he's pretty confused about where to start

I could relate that to my own experience trying to learn English (and struggling a lot).

I told him how I've spent so much time trying to learn English and ended up struggling to learn the verb to be, feeling stuck about not evolving at all.

I could only unblock it when I realized I needed a good reason to focus on it.

I put a goal in mind: I'll learn English to give talks, produce content and expand my network worldwide.

This led me to focus my studies on learning public speaking, writing skills in practice, creating presentations, and writing tech articles. I felt my English got to the top after it.

You'd think about the whole "why" behind your will to dive into something new

I said to him that before even starting a training course or reading tutorials, he should think of a project he wants to build.

He's a teacher and has many students. So he figured out that he could create an app to improve the engagement of his classes.

Now instead of learning programming, deep diving into data structures, databases, and the storm of information out there, he'd learn what's required to build something real that helps him in his own life and avoid wasting time with unnecessary concepts in the beginning.

I'd say my first two years of studying programming at the university were just a waste of time.

If my teachers pushed me forward from the beginning to create something real, I'd learn faster and have more questions to ask than just copy and paste academic concepts and not use them at all.

How about you, what'd you do if today you were to start programming?
